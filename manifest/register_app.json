  "description": "Boost your photo and video revenue by automatically capturing lost sales with PicThrive. After a trip, guests leave without buying their photos or videos. Via this integration, the algorithm identifies who has not purchased photos on-site and automatically connects them to their tripâ€™s album for the opportunity to buy online. This powerful feature sees a 35% higher conversion rate than simply placing a store link in a standard follow up email.",
